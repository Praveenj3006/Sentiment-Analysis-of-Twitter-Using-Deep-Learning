# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Twitter-Using-Deep-Learning
"Developed a Sentiment Analysis model for Twitter data using deep learning techniques, classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral."

The Sentiment Analysis on Twitter using Deep Learning project focuses on extracting insights from social media data, specifically Twitter, by analyzing the sentiment expressed in tweets. The goal of the project is to classify the sentiments of tweets into categories like positive, negative, or neutral. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Problem Statement:
Social media platforms generate vast amounts of unstructured text data. The challenge is to develop a model that can automatically interpret this data and classify the sentiment of each tweet. This can be useful for businesses, governments, or individuals to understand public opinion on various topics.

Steps Involved:
1. Data Collection: Twitter API was used to gather a large dataset of tweets. These tweets were related to specific keywords or hashtags for better context and analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: The raw data contained various noisy elements like links, special characters, and irrelevant information. Techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization were employed to clean the text and prepare it for analysis.

3. Model Building: 
   - A deep learning model, specifically a recurrent neural network (RNN) or long short-term memory (LSTM), was used to process the sequential nature of text data.
   - The model was trained to learn patterns from the cleaned tweets and their associated sentiment labels.

4. Training and Testing: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. The model was trained using backpropagation and optimization techniques like Adam to minimize loss.

5. Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to measure the effectiveness of the sentiment classification. The model's performance was validated on unseen data.

Tools and Technologies:
- Python: For scripting and model development.
- Keras/TensorFlow: Deep learning libraries for building and training the sentiment analysis model.
- Twitter API: For data collection.
- NLP Techniques: Used for text preprocessing.
  
Results:
The model successfully classified tweets based on sentiment with high accuracy. It proved to be a valuable tool for analyzing large-scale social media data, offering insights into public opinion trends.

This project demonstrates the ability to apply deep learning techniques in natural language processing (NLP) to solve real-world problems.
